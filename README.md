# voowols

Some coworkers and I came up with a slack channel in which we have to follow a special for messaging. For every letter in a word, every vowel is replaced with an "o" and every "o" is replaced with "oo". 

This app brings that idea to life. 

Additionally, the [Speech Synthesis Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) is used to read the converted text in a variety of voices, accents, pitches, and languages.
